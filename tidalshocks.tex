%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[a4paper,fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\citet{2018arXiv181200014W} study the effect of a tidal

A similar study was conducted three decades ago, although the scope was tidal
disruption of galaxies rather than of globular clusters.
\citep{1985ApJ...295..374A, 1986ApJ...307...97A}


How clusters are affected by tidal shocks:
\citep{1958ApJ...127...17S}
\citep{1987degc.book.....S}
\citep{2006MNRAS.371..793G}
\citep{2011MNRAS.414.1339K}
\citep{2016MNRAS.463L.103G}


``By defining a tidal heating parameter \citep{2003ApJ...582..141G}, cluster's
mass loss history can be estimated for any known tidal history.''


\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:simulations}

\textsc{nbody6} \citep{2003gnbs.book.....A,2010gnbs.book.....A}
\textsc{nbody6tt} \citep{2011MNRAS.418..759R,2015ascl.soft02010R,2015MNRAS.448.3416R}

``Mode A: the tidal information is extracted from a galaxy or cosmology 
simulation, in the form of tidal tensors, along one orbit. This method is 
described in \citep{2011MNRAS.418..759R}''

``Mode B: the user defines a numerical function which takes position and time 
as arguments, and returns the galactic potential. This method is described in
\citep{2015MNRAS.448.3416R}''

\begin{itemize}
    \item nbody6tt: Tidal tensors in N-body simulations \citep{2015ascl.soft02010R}
\end{itemize}

Initial cluster density: \citet{1966AJ.....71...64K} model with $W_0 = \{5, 7\}$
or \citep{1911MNRAS..71..460P} profile.

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

The research was conducted using the Python \citep{python}
programming language with the IPython \citep{2007CSE.....9c..21P} environment.
We used the NumPy \citep{2011CSE....13b..22V}, SciPy \citep{scipy}, and Astropy 
\citep{2013A&A...558A..33A} packages. Plots were generated using 
Matplotlib \citep{2007CSE.....9...90H}.
